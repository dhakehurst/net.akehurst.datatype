/**
 * Marks a type (class/interface) as representing a datatype. A datatype is similar to a 'C' language concept of a struct.
 *
 * <p>A datatype is expected to conform to the following constraints:
 * <li>accessors/mutators should only be for primitive types, collections, or other datatypes</li>
 * <li>accessors/mutators should create a tree structure, i.e. they are assumed to define a composition relationship unless otherwise defined</li>
 * <li>accessors/mutators should be marked with the annotations Reference if they reference something in another part of the tree</li>
 * <li>accessors should be marked with the annotations Query if it computes a value rather than containing it</li>
